Stratus is a game streaming service that enables users to play games directly
from their web browser. It starts stream sessions in under 2 seconds and
achieves round-trip "click-to-photon" latencies of as little as 40ms while
streaming 1080p game video at 60fps. Stratus is unique among cloud gaming
solutions for its use of Linux-based streaming servers, the WebTransport
protocol for streaming to web browsers, and a custom Wayland proxy for capturing
game video.

## Project Structure

Project planning and agent guidance:

- [`TODO.md`](TODO.md): active project task tracker
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md): context and workflow guidance for AI coding agents

Stratus is composed of three main components: a cluster of streaming servers
that run games, a web client that streams games from the streaming servers, and
a coordination server that pairs clients with streaming servers. The source code
for all three is located in this monorepo, which is organized as follows:

- `backend/`: the coordination server
- `design/`: design files for the frontend UI
- `docs/`: content for the [Stratus blog](https://www.playstratus.io/#Blogs)
- `frontend/`: the Stratus website and streaming client
- `games/`: scripts for packaging games to run on Stratus
- `os/`: scripts and packages for provisioning new streaming servers
- `stratusd/`: the streaming server daemon

Each subdirectory contains a `REAMDE.md` with instructions on building the
component locally for development. Refer to the [Stratus
blog](https://www.playstratus.io/blogs/architecture) for more details on the
architecture of Stratus.

For a containerized single-node self-host setup with browser streaming, see
[`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).


## Deployment

For local-only self-hosting (no AWS dependency) with Docker and optional Google
or local username/password auth, use the setup guide in
[`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md).

To deploy an entire fully-featured Stratus instance from scratch, follow the
instructions below. Alternatively, it is possible to run just the Stratus
streaming server and connect via our [Direct Connect][direct-connect] page
without any additional setup (no Google OAuth, AWS DynamoDB, coordination
server, etc) by following the instructions [here][stratusd-setup].

[direct-connect]: https://www.playstratus.io/direct-connect
[stratusd-setup]: https://github.com/PlayStratus/Stratus/blob/main/stratusd/README.md#development-setup

1.  **Google OAuth:** Register a Google OAuth client and obtain the access
    credentials (client ID and secret).

2.  **AWS:** Create an AWS account and obtain the access credentials (region,
    key ID, and access key).

3.  **DynamoDB:** Configure and populate a DynamoDB instance consisting of the
    following tables and columns:

    - **Games**: `GameID` (string), `developer` (string), `genres` (list of
      strings), `lDescript` (string), `s3` (list of strings), `sDescript`
      (string), `title` (string)
    - **Users**: `UserID` (string), `Username` (string), `Email` (string)

4.  **Web Client:** The frontend is a Next.js web app packaged as a Docker
    image. Deploy it by running

    ```
    $ cd frontend
    $ cp .env.example .env
    $ vim .env # set environment variables
    $ docker build -t stratus-frontend .
    $ sudo docker run -p 80:3000 --env-file=.env stratus-frontend
    ```

5.  **Coordination Server:** The coordination server is also packaged as a
    Docker image. Deploy it by running

    ```
    $ cd backend
    $ cp .env.example .env
    $ vim .env # set environment variables
    $ docker build -t stratus-backend .
    $ sudo docker run -p 80:4000 --env-file=.env stratus-backend
    ```

    You will most likely also want to configure both containers to run
    automatically and use a reverse proxy to serve them over HTTPS.

6.  **Streaming Servers:** The streaming servers are deployed on bare metal. For
    each one, boot into a live Arch Linux environment and run the Stratus OS
    installer:

    ```
    # curl -sL os.playstratus.io/install.sh | bash
    ```

    After rebooting you will be able to log into the `stratusd` user account
    over the console or an SSH connection to perform system administration
    tasks. The core streaming service runs under the `stratusd` systemd service.

7.  **Start Streaming:** The streaming servers should appear on the frontend's
    `/dashboard` page within 15 minutes. Once they do, you can log in and start
    a stream session.


## Project Status

Stratus was originally developed by a team of Oregon State University students
as a senior capstone project, released in May 2026. The hosted public instance
is no longer running, but the project is actively maintained as a self-hostable
platform. Work is ongoing to support local-first deployment with Docker and GPU
passthrough for fully remote browser-based gaming sessions.
